# Welcome to the SFDX Batch Orchestrator

Fancy meeting you here! I hope you enjoy your stay in this documentation. The SFDX Batch Orchestrator is a tool to make scheduling of Apex Jobs more handy than fiddling around with Anonymous Apex and the "Scheudled Jobs" view. With it, you can configure your Jobs with ease, using just the Salesforce UI and some records.
