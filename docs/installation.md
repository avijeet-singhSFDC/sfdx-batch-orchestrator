For a button to deploy the unmanaged package, please use the linked button in the README of the repository.

Simply click on one of the Buttons to install the App (it's recommended to install the Unlocked Package to easily benefit from future updates). After this, assign the "Batch Job Scheduler" Permission Set to anyone who needs to access. Administrators automatically get access to the App.

This package requires <a href="https://github.com/dschibster/sfdx-trigger-factory">SFDX Trigger Factory</a>  to be installed for the processing of Trigger Handlers.
